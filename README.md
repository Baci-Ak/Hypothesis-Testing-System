## üìù Description:
The Hypothesis Testing System is a Python-based application created to simplify hypothesis testing on data. This system enables users to run both one-tailed and two-tailed t-tests on various items or combinations of items in a dataset, giving them insightful information about the statistical significance of their data

Hypothesis testing is a fundamental statistical technique used to make inferences about a population based on sample data. It is a systematic approach that allows us to test the validity of a claim or hypothesis about a population parameter, such as the mean or the proportion, using sample data. The process involves formulating a null hypothesis (H0) and an alternative hypothesis (H1), collecting data, and then using statistical tests to determine if there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

### ü•Ö Aim
The aim of this Hypothesis Testing System project is to develop a flexible and user-friendly tool for conducting hypothesis tests on data. Users of the system can run one-tailed and two-tailed t-tests to investigate the statistical significance of certain items or groups of items in their dataset. The project seeks to assist data analysts and researchers in making data-driven decisions based on the significance of their data, thereby improving the whole data analysis process. This is accomplished by offering unambiguous interpretations of the test results.

#### üíª Features:
* One-Tailed Test: The system provides an option for users to perform one-tailed t-tests on individual items in a dataset. A one-tailed test allows users to test whether the mean of a sample is significantly greater than or less than a specified value (null hypothesis).

* Two-Tailed Test: Users can also perform two-tailed t-tests between two items in the Data. A two-tailed test determines whether there is a significant difference between the means of two samples, without specifying a direction.

* User Interaction: The system allows users to interactively input their preferences, including the type of test (one-tailed or two-tailed), the significance level (alpha), and the items they want to test.

* Data Visualization: The system provides users with a table containing relevant statistical information, including the mean of each observation, variance, observation size, Pearson correlation, t-statistic, p-values, and the difference in means.

##### üßß Usage:
* Hypothesis Testing: Users can choose between a one-tailed or two-tailed test. For one-tailed tests, users can specify whether they want to test for a greater-than or less-than null hypothesis.

* Item Selection: Users can select the specific item(s) they wish to test from the available items in the DataFrame.

* Significance Level: Users can define the significance level (alpha) for the test, which determines the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis H0.

* Result Display: After the test is performed, the system displays the result of the hypothesis test along with relevant statistical information in a formatted table.

###### üö° Benefits

* Easy-to-use: The Hypothesis Testing System provides a user-friendly interface that simplifies the process of conducting hypothesis tests.

* Customization: Users have the flexibility to choose the test type, items, and significance level, enabling personalized analysis.

* Data-driven Decision Making: The system empowers users to make informed decisions based on the statistical significance of their data.

* Error Handling: The system includes error handling mechanisms to prevent unexpected issues during user input and data processing.


The Hypothesis Testing System is a valuable tool for data scientists, analysts, and researchers who want to conduct rigorous statistical analysis on their data to draw meaningful conclusions and make data-driven decisions. Whether exploring new research questions, conducting A/B testing, or analyzing experimental data, this system offers a robust and reliable solution for hypothesis testing.
